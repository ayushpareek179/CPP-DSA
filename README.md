# C++ DSA Course
This repository contains demonstrations and practice files from the course titled 
[Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/) by Mr Abdul Bari.

## Description
The course tackles the most common data structres and algorithms in the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) 
and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programming languages. Structres include [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure),
[strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)), [linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), 
[stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), [queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)), 
[binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree), [binary search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), 
[AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree), [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) and 
[graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)).  Algorithms include those on [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm), 
[hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) and various others, associated with the aforementioned data structures. 
It was underwent in a bid to build upon the knowledge from the previous course, the repository for which can
be found [here](https://github.com/ayushpareek179/CPP-course). 

Before perusing the code, please note that:
* Initially, the code had been written in both the languages but eventually, the elegance and simplicity 
of classes meant that C++ was used for large parts.
* The folders have been named as per the numeric order in the course itself. Thus, **Part_Fifteen** corresponds to the fifteenth section.
* Some files _may not_ have all the functions for a particular data structure in one single document. Efforts were undertaken
to minimize this disparity, especially as the course progressed.
* The [Standard Template Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library)'s use has been kept to a minimum. 
However, starting from binary trees, it was adopted for improving reabaility. 
* Graphs have been implemented using adjacency matrix - in the course as well as in this repository - even though it is not 
a very efficient way of doing so.

## Dependencies
* [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used for typing and executing these files.
* [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools) and [Code Runner](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) were extensions
that proved to be indispensable for the purpose.
